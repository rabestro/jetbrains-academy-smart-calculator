# JetBrains Academy Project: Smart Calculator 

## About 
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

## Learning outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about arrays, stacks, strings, and queues. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue. You will also get a closer experience with BigInteger class that allows storing large volumes of data with precision for geo-data or physical quantities.

### Work on project. Stage 7/8: Iâ€™ve got the power 

At this stage, your program should support for multiplication *, integer division / and parentheses (...). They have a higher priority than addition + and subtraction -. Do not forget about variables; they, and the unary minus operator, should still work. Modify the result of the /help command to explain all possible operators.

Here is an example of an expression that contains all possible operations:
```
3 + 8 * ((4 + 3) * 2 + 1) - 6 / (2 + 1)
```
The result is 121.

A general expression can contain many parentheses and operations with different priorities. It is difficult to calculate such expressions if you do not use special methods. Fortunately, there is a fairly effective and universal solution, using a stack, to calculate the most general expressions.

#### Input/Output example
```
8 * 3 + 12 * (4 - 2)
48
2 - 2 + 3
3
4 * (2 + 3
Invalid expression
-10
-10
a=4
b=5
c=6
a*2+b*3+c*(2+3)
53
1 +++ 2 * 3 -- 4
11
3 *** 5
Invalid expression
4+3)
Invalid expression
```

The program should not stop until the user enters the **/exit** command.

Note that a sequence of + (like +++ or +++++) is an admissible operator that should be interpreted as a single plus. A sequence of - (like -- or ---) is also an admissible operator and its meaning depends on the length. If a user enters a sequence of * or /, the program must print a message that the expression is invalid.

**As a bonus**, you may add the power operator ^ that has higher priority than * and /.
```
2^2
4
2*2^3
16
```

### Work on project. Stage 8/8: Very big 

At this stage, your program must support arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) with very large numbers as well as parentheses to change the priority within an expression.

There are two ways to solve it. As an easy way, you may use the standard class for working with large numbers, just correctly apply it to your solution. If you want to practice algorithms, you may develop your own class for large numbers and implement algorithms for the listed arithmetic operations.

#### Input/Output example
```
112234567890 + 112234567890 * (10000000999 - 999)
1122345679012234567890
a = 800000000000000000000000
b = 100000000000000000000000
a + b
900000000000000000000000
/exit
Bye!
```
The program should not stop until the user enters the **/exit** command.
